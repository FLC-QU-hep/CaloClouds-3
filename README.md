# Rolling implementation of CaloClouds and friends

Spawned the CaloClouds model published in ([arXiv:2305.04847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04847)).
and also *CaloClouds II: Ultra-Fast Geometry-Independent Highly-Granular Calorimeter Simulation* ([arXiv:2309.05704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05704)).


Not sure how to do something with git or gitlab? Please start by checking the docs here; [`gitlab.desy.de/ftx-sft/Documentation/-/tree/master/git`](https://gitlab.desy.de/ftx-sft/Documentation/-/tree/master/git)

## Repository structure

The repository is structured around a module called `pointcloud`, this is the bulk of the code.
The entry points, however, are all in the `scripts` folder.

- `pointcloud`: The parent module for code to be imported.
    - `configs.py`: A symlink to the default configs file. Changes are ignored by git by default.
    - `config_varients`: Library of configs files that `configs.py` could point to. You can also import them directly.
    - `evaluation`: Module containing functions for preparing data and calculating statistics for model evaluation.
    - `metadata`: Contains a set of subfolders (and symlinks to subfolders) specifying the metadata for each dataset. For example, detector geometry.
    - `models`: Model classes themselves, and some helper code specific to models.
    - `utils`: Misc code that is useful at multiple points.
- `scripts`: Code that doesn't get imported. Every file below this directory is an entry point.
    - `pointcloud`: Symlink back to the parent module, so that scripts can import code from it without messing with the path.
    - `evaluation`: Scripts for plotting and comparing the data generated by the models to the ground truth.
    - `jobsubmission`: Scripts for submitting jobs on cluster computers.
- `programming_utils`: Meta level utilities for maintaining the repository.
- `test`: The unit tests.
    - `pointcloud`: Symlink back to the parent module, so that tests can import code from it without messing with the path.
    - `scripts`: Symlink to scripts module; some scripts there get regression tests and thus need to be imported.
    - `programming_utils`: Symlink to programming utilities module, to allow for CI to check the repository is well maintained.

## Getting started

Configs are stored in [`pointcloud/config_varients/`](./pointcloud/config_varients/), and the default choice is determined by what the soft link `pointcloud/configs.py` is pointing to.
To make a new config;
- Make the base file with `cd pointcloud && cp config_varients/default.py config_varients/my_funky_new_config_name.py`.
- Edit the funky new config to your taste.
    It's also possible to `from .config_varients import default` to inherit from that `Configs` class, and change only what you need.
    See [`config_varients/wish.py`](./pointcloud/config_varients/wish.py) for an example of that.
- Remove the existing symbolic link with `rm configs.py`
- Link your config `ln -s config_varients/my_funky_new_config_name.py configs.py`

The teacher model is trained using [`scripts/main.py`](./scripts/main.py), and the student model is trained with [`scripts/cd.py`](./scripts/cd.py).
It should be called as a script, like; `python3 script/main.py`.

The Shower Flow (to predict energy and hist per layer) is trained via the notebook [`scripts/ShowerFlow.ipynb`](./scripts/ShowerFlow.ipynb).
It will work in a jupyter notebook.

The polynomial fits for the occupancy calculations are performed in [`scripts/occupancy_scale.ipynb`](./scripts/occupancy_scale.ipynb).

An outline of the sampling process for both CaloClouds II and CaloClouds II (CM) can be found in [`pointcloud/evaluation/generate.py`](./pointcloud/evaluation/generate.py).

The timing of the models is benchmarked with [`scripts/timing.py`](./scripts/timing.py), also called as a script.

The training dataset is available under the link: https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/s/XfDwx33ryERwPdi

But if you are connected to `beegfs` you can also find the relevant goodies in Anatolii's directories.
For example;
`/beegfs/desy/user/akorol/data/calo-clouds/hdf5/high_granular_grid/train/10-90GeV_x36_grid_regular_524k_float32.hdf5`
